/// format.h defines the file format used by the server.  Note that the format
/// changes between phase 1 and phase 2 of the assignment, and again between
/// phase 2 and phase 3.

/// In phase 1, there is only one table that needs to be persisted to file: the
/// authentication table.  Furthermore, this authentication table is only
/// persisted in response to an explicit SAV command.  To persist the table to a
/// file, each entry needs to be written to the file.  The format of each entry
/// is as follows:
///
/// Authentication entry format:
/// - 8-byte constant AUTHAUTH
/// - 8-byte binary write of the length of the username
/// - Binary write of the bytes of the username
/// - 8-byte binary write of the length of the salt
/// - Binary write of the bytes of the salt
/// - 8-byte binary write of the length of the hashed password
/// - Binary write of the bytes of the hashed password
/// - 8-byte binary write of the length of the profile file
/// - If the profile file isn't empty, binary write of the bytes of the profile
///   file
/// - Binary write of some bytes of padding, to ensure that the next entry will
///   be aligned on an 8-byte boundary.
///
/// Note that there are no newline or other delimiters required by the format.
/// The 8-byte constant, coupled with the *binary* writes of the lengths of the
/// fields, suffice to unambiguously represent the file contents.  Note that the
/// username, salt, and hashed password must each be at least one byte.

/// A unique 8-byte code to use as a prefix each time an AuthTable Entry is
/// written to disk.
const std::string AUTHENTRY = "AUTHAUTH";
